## Introduction and Objectives

Alzheimerâ€™s Disease (AD) and Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) are neurodegenerative diseases with overlapping symptoms. The aim of this study is to identify metabolomic biomarkers from serum samples that distinguish between AD, DLB, and healthy controls (HC) using machine learning models.

## Methods

### Data Preprocessing

- **Sample Composition**: 55 AD, 52 HC, and 14 DLB serum samples.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Biomarkers with >20% missing values were excluded, and values below the Limit of Detection (LOD) were imputed using LOD/2.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to explore data structure and check for batch effects and gender differences.

```{r pca, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
# PCA plot (sample data assumed)
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(PC1 = rnorm(100), PC2 = rnorm(100), Group = rep(c("AD", "HC", "DLB"), length.out = 100))
ggplot(df, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = Group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("PCA of Serum Metabolomics Data")
```

### Statistical Analysis and Machine Learning Models

T-tests and fold changes were conducted for individual biomarkers, and AUC was used to assess discriminatory power.

We applied Lasso, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost to classify AD, HC, and DLB groups. Models were evaluated using cross-validation, and performance metrics such as ROC curves were calculated.

```{r roc-curve, echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
# Example ROC curve (sample data assumed)
df_roc <- data.frame(FPR = c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 1), 
                     TPR = c(0, 0.6, 0.75, 0.8, 0.9, 1),
                     Group = "AD vs HC")
ggplot(df_roc, aes(x = FPR, y = TPR)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 1.5) +
  geom_abline(linetype = "dashed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("ROC Curve Example")
```

## Results

Significant biomarkers were identified for AD vs HC, AD vs DLB, and DLB vs HC. Machine learning models achieved high classification accuracy with AUC values ~0.9 for AD vs HC. Including APOE genotype improved model performance.

## Conclusion

The study identified metabolomic signatures that distinguish between AD, DLB, and HC groups. Machine learning models demonstrated high classification accuracy. Future work will extend this analysis to ~2000 urine samples from the DELCODE cohort for broader validation.
